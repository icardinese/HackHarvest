# HackHarvest
A way for food waste to not actually be wasted!

# Quick Start Up Guide
***Disclimaer**: Although you could use the food searching features in this application. Things like the google maps API, and OpenAI API might not be
accessible due to security issues with the API key so it has been temporary shut off. I didn't want to change the commit but because this repository is public
I didn't want this key to be misused by malicious intent. If you want these keys to be up and running for judging please let me know!

**Setup the Virtual Environment**

A pre-requisite is to have python 3.12.4 specifically installed on your machine. Any other version I can't guarentee it will work smoothly

  1. Download the software and open powershell. (If you opened powershell through VS code's or any IDE's terminal then move on to step 2). Change the path of the powershell to the location of the folder.
```
cd (path)
```
For example my path is:
```
cd C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\CODE\HackHarvest
```
  2. In the powershell type the following command:
```
py -m venv venv
```
  3. Activate the virtual environment (Only on windows):
```
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
  4. Install the dependencies and their corresponding version:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  5. run the python file called "app.py"
```
  6. Run app.py and in the terminal click on the link (cntrl + leftclick):
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
You have finished setting up the pre-requisites for the program and can run it freely!!
